# FCRef-Swift-iOS
A small iOS application that allows you to add football clubs to a TableView and display their stadiums on a map using MapKit. Through various interactions, including tapping on a club's logo on the map or in the TableView, you can access a detailed profile of the selected club. The goal is to provide a functional structure (although with an error regarding the dimensions of certain elements in the TableView) and some functions that facilitate data conversion.

This project serves as an opportunity for developers who are learning Swift to familiarize themselves with multiple concepts at once. It also invites experienced developers to share their knowledge and improve this initial version through collaboration on this Git repository. Feel free to contribute, share your discoveries, observations, or ask questions. Learning is an ongoing process, and there is no shame in seeking clarification regardless of your level of expertise. I have added some annotations in the code to help you better understand certain functions.
